    <section>
        <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Theoretical modeling of the optical and photovoltaic characteristics of highly
            efficient textured silicon solar cells (SC), including short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage and
            photoconversion efficiency, has been performed in this work. In the modeling, such recombination mechanisms
            as non-radiative exciton recombination relative to the Auger mechanism with the participation of a deep
            recombination level and recombination in the space charge region (SCR) was additionally taken into account.
            In a simple approximation, the external quantum efficiency of the photocurrent for the indicated SC in the
            long-wavelength absorption region has been simulated. A theory has been proposed for calculating the
            thickness dependences of short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage and photoconversion efficiency in them.
            The calculated dependences are carefully compared with the experimental results obtained for SC with the
            p+-i-?-Si:H/n-c-Si/i-n+-?-Si:H architecture and the photoconversion efficiency of about 23%. As a result of
            this comparison, good agreement between the theoretical and calculated dependences has been obtained. It has
            been ascertained that without taking into account recombination in SCR, a quantitative agreement between the
            experimental and theoretical light I V characteristics and the dependence of the output power in the SC load
            on the voltage on it cannot be obtained. The proposed approach and the obtained results can be used to
            optimize the characteristics of textured SC based on monocrystalline silicon.</p>
